A programmable thermostat could save you hundreds of dollars while making your home effortlessly comfortable. Unfortunately, all those buttons and setting have intimidated people for years. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you've been intimidated in the past by your programmable thermostat, don't despair. Having a better home is easier than you think, and it's all just a few clicks away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3>Make Your Savings Plan</h3>\r\nThe ideal time to setback your thermostat is when your home is empty or when you're asleep. Think about when you typically go to bed, leave in the morning, and come home at night. Set your thermostat to lower your heat or air-conditioning while you're asleep or at work, and turn the heat back up by the time you wake up or get home. During the winter, rolling back your thermostat from 72\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 for eight hours a day will save you 12% on your heating bill.<cite>Department of Energy, Energy Savers, <a href=\"http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12720\">Thermostats and Control Systems</a></cite> You can achieve similar savings in the summer by raising your thermostat in the summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><h3>Common Thermostat Myths</h3>\r\n<ul><li><strong>\"If I set my thermostat to 80\u00b0, my house will get hotter, faster.\"</strong><br>\r\nYour heating and cooling system only has two modes: on and off. The rate at which it heats or cools your home is unaffected by the temperature setting. By setting your thermostat higher, you\u2019re just ensuring that your heater will be on for longer than you need and your house will be hotter or colder than you want. Set your thermostat to the temperature you desire. \r\n<li><strong>\"Turning my thermostat down doesn\u2019t really save energy! My HVAC system will just have to work harder when I get back.\"</strong><br>\r\nUsing your thermostat to turn your heat or air conditioner down will save energy. Consider the following example:<br>\r\nLet\u2019s say you want your home to be 72\u00b0 degrees in the winter. You leave your house at 8am and return at 6pm. If you have a programmable thermostat set to turn the heat off, you will use absolutely no energy during that 10-hour period. If you leave your thermostat at 72\u00b0, your heat will continually switch on and off, heating an empty house for 10 hours. \r\n<li><strong>\"My pipes will freeze!\"</strong><br>\r\nIf your pipes are not well insulated inside your home, and the outside air temperature is below 20\u00b0, you should consider keeping your thermostat above 55\u00b0.<cite><a href=\"http://www.weather.com/activities/homeandgarden/home/hometips/severeweather/pipefreeze_prevent.html\">Severe Weather Readiness</a> Weather.com. n.d. 7 Apr 2010</cite> This setback still allows room for significant savings. However, a much more effective way to prevent your pipes from freezing and bursting is to insulate exposed pipes. </ul></p> {% action_form %}", "users_completed": 0, "teaser": "Do you want a comfortable home that requires no effort or planning?

If you have a low-flow shower head, there should be no more than two gallons of water in the bucket after a minute. \r\nIn reality, most homes do not come with low-flow shower heads installed. Even if your shower head is relatively new, it's flow rate is likely around 2.5gpm.

Really small &mdash; many CFLs now contain less than 1 milligram of mercury.<cite>Ibid.</cite> To put that in perspective, the average aspirin tablet weighs 325 milligrams. The mercury in these new CFLs weighs as much as 1/325 of an aspirin tablet. Old thermometers, on the other hand, contain around 500 milligrams of mercury<cite>Ibid.</cite> </p>\r\n<p>Because they do contain a small amount of mercury, CFLs should be recycled at the end of their lives. Visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.earth911.org\">Earth911</a> to find a recycling center near you.</p> \r\n<p>No mercury is released when the bulbs are in tact. If you do break a bulb, it's okay. Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes. When you come back, use tape to pick up any shards of glass, and vacuum the area thoroughly. For more information about CFL disposal, visit the <a href=\"http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf\">Energy Star information page</a>.</p>\r\n<h4>More CFLs = less mercury</h4><br>\r\n<p>Say what? It's true. The adoption of CFLs will actually reduce the amount of mercury released into our environment. Since CFLs are so much more efficient, they require much less energy than incandescent bulbs to produce the same amount of light. That means we can significantly reduce our demand for coal, the most common source of electricity in the U.S. Burning coal is a dirty business. It releases all sorts of nasty chemicals, including a lot of mercury. When you compare their life cycle impacts, CFLs leave incadescents behind in a cloud of smog:\r\n<p><img src=\"http://rahstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/actionmedia/mercury_cfl_coal_graph.png\"><cite>Ibid.</cite></p>\r\n", "users_completed": 0, "teaser": "Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) are awesome in so many ways.
