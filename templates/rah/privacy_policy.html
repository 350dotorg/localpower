        </li>

        We do not solicit personally identifying information from children. Visitors who are under 13 years of age should

    <h2>
        Use of Cookies
    </h2>
    <p>
        We may use cookies to tailor your experience on this Website according to the preferences you have specified. When
        you visit the Website, your browser may save a tiny piece of information on your computer. This information
        personalizes and improves your experience online. It is not possible and we do not attempt to access information
        from other websites. Our cookies do not contain any personal identifiable information. You have the ability to
        accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser

    <h2>
        IP Addresses, Log Files, and Data Analysis
    </h2>
    <p>
        As with any website operator, we analyze our Website logs to constantly improve the value of Website. We use an
        external service to provide real-time reporting to us and our authorized agents of browser accesses to our Website.
        This includes page views, unique visitors, repeat visitors, frequency of visits, and peak-volume traffic periods. We
        do not use this service to gather, request, record, require, collect, or track any Internet users' personally
        identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p>
        We log IP addresses which describe the location of your computer or network on the Internet. This information is
        helpful for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We may also use third-party services such as Google
        Analytics. These practices help us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our Website. We
        may also use embedded images in emails to track open rates for our mailings. This practice helps us determine which
        mailings appeal most to our members.
    </p>
    <p>
        URLs contained in emails may contain an ID that enables us to correctly identify the person who takes an action
        using a web page. We use URLs to simplify the process of signing petitions and filling out surveys. We may
        occasionally present a shortened URL that references a longer URL that contains an ID. We do this to simplify the
        display, to prevent links from becoming broken when copied, and to ensure compatibility with email programs that do
        not handle long URLs. When shortened URL is displayed in an email, you will see the full URL in the browser's
        address bar when you access the page.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Petitions and Surveys
    </h2>
    <p>
        For petitions and surveys you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public
        information &ndash; for example, we may provide compilations of petitions, with your comments, to the intended recipient
        of the petition or survey. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to the
        intended recipient of the petition or survey as part of the petition or survey. This is standard industry practice
        in such situations. In no such case will we disclose your email address or phone number, without your permission. We
        may also make your comments, along with your first name, city and state available to the press and public online.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Changes to this Statement
    </h2>
    <p>
        We may occasionally update this privacy statement especially as new features are added to this Website. If there are
        material changes to this statement or in how we will use your personal information, we will prominently note such
        changes prior to their implementation. We encourage you to periodically review this page to be informed of how we
        are protecting your information.
