Connect your vampires to a smart power strip to make your home vampire-free.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Other ways to slay</h2>\r\n<p>Smart power strips make saving energy a no-brainer, which is why Repower at Home recommends them. However, you can also slay vampires by unplugging them, or switching off a conventional power strip when you're done using your electronics for the day. Remember, your electronics will still be protected from \u201csurges\u201d when the power strip is turned off or unplugged.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>The surprising costs of vampire power</h2>\r\n<p>How do energy vampires drink up so much energy? Let's take your DVD/VCR player as an example. Obviously, when it's on, it uses energy to play your movies and CDs. But when it's \"off,\" it still needs energy to power its infrared sensor, which is waiting for a signal from your remote control. An energy vampire isn't too smart. It doesn't know that it's 3am and you're not going to be watching season four of \"The Sopranos\" anytime soon. So it lurks, sucking energy the whole time. Many electronics also use energy to power clocks and lights when they're \"off.\"</p>\r\n<h3>Adding up the waste</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    When it's playing a movie, the average DVD/VCR player uses around 15 Watts. But when it's \"off,\" it uses around 5 Watts to power all those other features.<cite>\"<a href=\"http://standby.lbl.gov/summary-table.html\">Standby Power:\r\n    Data</a>.\" Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory. n.d. 26 April 2010.</cite> Let's say you use your DVD/VCR player for one hour every day, and it's \"off\" for the remaining 23 hours. How much energy is used during each period?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    15 Watts x 1 hour = 15 Watt-hours of energy<br/>\r\n    5 Watts x 23 hours = 115 Watt-hours of energy\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Eeek! <strong>Nearly 90% of the energy used by the average DVD player is consumed when it's turned off</strong>! That's even above\r\n    the average of 75% for electronics.<cite>http://www.energy.gov/applianceselectronics.htm</cite> It's time to get rid of energy vampires now!\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:8pt\">Note: The products and video shown in this action are for illustrative purposes only.

Think about when you typically go to bed, leave in the morning and come home at night. <strong>Set your thermostat to lower your heat or air conditioning while you're asleep or at work, and turn back up by the time you wake up or get home.</strong> During the winter, rolling back your thermostat from 72\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 for eight hours a day will save you around 12% on your heating bill.<cite>Department of Energy, Energy Savers, <a href=\"http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12720\">Thermostats and Control Systems</a></cite> You can achieve similar savings in the summer by raising your thermostat.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://rahstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/actionmedia/thermostat activity.pdf\">Download the setback activity sheet</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Common Thermostat Myths</h3>\r\n<h4>\"If I set my thermostat to 80\u00b0, my house will get hotter, faster.\"</h4>\r\n<p>Your heating and cooling system only has two modes: on and off. The rate at which it heats or cools your home is unaffected by the temperature setting. By setting your thermostat higher, you\u2019re just ensuring that your heater will be on for longer than you need and your house will be hotter or colder than you want. Set your thermostat to the temperature you actually want and let it be.</p>\r\n<h4>\"Turning my thermostat down doesn\u2019t really save energy! My HVAC system will just have to work harder when I get back.\"</h4>\r\n<p>This is a common myth, but it's false. Using your thermostat to turn your heat or air conditioner down will save energy. Period.</p>\r\n<p>Consider the following example: Let\u2019s say you want your home to be 72\u00b0 degrees in the winter. You leave your house at 8am and return at 6pm. If you have a programmable thermostat set to turn the heat off, you will use absolutely no energy during that 10-hour period. If you leave your thermostat at 72\u00b0, your heat will continually switch on and off, heating an empty house for 10 hours.<br>\r\nWhen your programmable thermostat switches back on to heat your house, it will stay on for slightly longer than the thermostat that has been left alone. However, the slight increase in energy use during this time period pales in comparison to the energy saved during that 10-hour period.</p> \r\n<h4>\"My pipes will freeze!\"</h4>\r\n<p>If your pipes are not well-insulated inside your home, and the outside air temperature is below 20\u00b0, you should consider keeping your thermostat above 55\u00b0.<cite><a href=\"http://www.weather.com/activities/homeandgarden/home/hometips/severeweather/pipefreeze_prevent.html\">Severe Weather Readiness</a> Weather.com. n.d. 7 Apr 2010</cite> This setback still allows room for significant savings. However, a much more effective way to prevent your pipes from freezing and bursting is to <a href=\"http://repowerathome.com/actions/insulate-water-pipes/\">insulate exposed pipes</a>. </p> {% action_form %}", "users_completed": 0, "teaser": "Want a comfortable home with no hassle?

A 60 Watt incandescent bulb, for example, can be replaced by a 13-15 Watt CFL bulb. <cite>http://energystar.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/energystar.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2563</cite></p>\r\n<h3>Act now</h3>\r\n<p>It's hard to know when it's time to trade in your car for a newer model. Not so with incandescent light bulbs. Every day you wait, you're wasting energy that you could easily be saving. Replace those bulbs today.</p>\r\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\r\n<h3>What's the deal with mercury in CFLs?</h3>\r\n<p>The rumors are true: CFLs contain a small amount of mercury. Really small &mdash; many CFLs now contain less than 1 milligram of mercury.<cite>Ibid.</cite> To put that in perspective, the average aspirin tablet weighs 325 milligrams. Old thermometers, on the other hand, contain around 500 milligrams of mercury<cite>Ibid.</cite> </p>\r\n<p>Because they do contain a small amount of mercury, CFLs should be recycled at the end of their lives. Visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.earth911.org\">Earth911</a> to find a recycling center near you.</p> \r\n<p>No mercury is released when the bulbs are intact. If you do break a bulb, it's okay. Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes. When you come back, use tape to pick up any shards of glass, and vacuum the area thoroughly. For more information about CFL disposal, visit the <a href=\"http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf\">Energy Star information page</a>.</p>\r\n<h4>More CFLs = less mercury</h4>\r\n<p>Say what? It's true. The adoption of CFLs will actually reduce the amount of mercury released into our environment. Since CFLs are so much more efficient, they require much less energy than incandescent bulbs to produce the same amount of light. That means we can significantly reduce our demand for coal, the most common source of electricity in the U.S. Burning coal is a dirty business. It releases all sorts of nasty chemicals, including a lot of mercury. When you compare their life cycle impacts, CFLs leave incadescents behind in a cloud of soot.</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://rahstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/actionmedia/mercury_cfl_coal_graph.png\"><cite>Ibid.</cite>\r\n{% action_form %}", "users_completed": 0, "teaser": "Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) are awesome in so many ways.", "points": 158, "slug": "replace-your-incandescent-light-bulbs-with-cfls"}},

But did you know that taking just a few seconds every morning could save you hundreds of dollars a year? It's true! Your thermostat has the potential to be an enormous energy saver.</p>\r\n<h3>Make Your Savings Plan</h3>\r\n<p>The ideal time to set back your thermostat is when your home is empty or when you're asleep. During the winter, rolling back your thermostat from 72\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 for eight hours a day will save you around 12% on your heating bill.<cite>Department of Energy, Energy Savers, <a href=\"http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12720\">Thermostats and Control Systems</a></cite> You can achieve similar savings in the summer by raising your thermostat.</p>\r\n<h3>Get in the groove</h3>\r\n<p>Unlike programmable thermostats, you have to remember to turn back your manual thermostat every day. But how can you develop this money-saving habit? Here are some tips:</p>\r\n<ul><li>Put one person in your family in charge of setting the thermostat every day before you leave. This is a great job for elementary-aged children. Just like turning off lights, setting the thermostat teaches the importance of saving energy to the next generation.</li>\r\n<li>Always set your thermostat after doing the same activity. Do you make coffee every morning? Set your thermostat after you finish your cup of joe. By making it part of your routine, you're much more likely to remember to turn it back. </li></ul>\r\n<h3>Common Thermostat Myths</h3>\r\n<p><strong>\"If I set my thermostat to 80\u00b0, my house will get hotter, faster.\"</strong><br>\r\nYour heating and cooling system only has two modes: on and off. The rate at which it heats or cools your home is unaffected by the temperature setting. By setting your thermostat higher, you\u2019re just ensuring that your heater will be on for longer than you need and your house will be hotter or colder than you want. Set your thermostat to the temperature you actually want and let it be.</p>\r\n<p><strong>\"Turning my thermostat down doesn\u2019t really save energy! My HVAC system will just have to work harder when I get back.\"</strong><br>\r\nThis is a common myth, but it's false. Using your thermostat to turn your heat or air conditioner down will save energy. Period.<br> \r\nConsider the following example: Let\u2019s say you want your home to be 72\u00b0 degrees in the winter. You leave your house at 8am and return at 6pm. If you turn your heat off, you will use absolutely no energy during that 10-hour period. If you leave your thermostat at 72\u00b0, your heat will continually switch on and off, heating an empty house for 10 hours.<br>\r\nWhen you come home, you'll switch your thermostat back on. It will stay on for slightly longer than the thermostat that has been left alone. However, the slight increase in energy use during this time period pales in comparison to the energy saved during that 10-hour period.</p> \r\n<p><strong>\"My pipes will freeze!\"</strong><br>\r\nIf your pipes are not well-insulated inside your home, and the outside air temperature is below 20\u00b0, you should consider keeping your thermostat above 55\u00b0.<cite><a href=\"http://www.weather.com/activities/homeandgarden/home/hometips/severeweather/pipefreeze_prevent.html\">Severe Weather Readiness</a> Weather.com. n.d. 7 Apr 2010</cite> This setback still allows room for significant savings.
