That's your money escaping!<cite>Ibid.</cite>\r\n\r\nFix it with these three easy steps:\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 1: Size your hot water heater</h3>\r\nYou'll need to know the gallon size of your hot water tank. Your manual has this information, but if you're like us, your manual is long gone.\r\n\r\nNo big.  Most residential hot water heaters hold 30-50 gallons.<cite>Nunan, Jon. \"<a href=\"http://www.servicemagic.com/article.show.Hot-Water-Needs.8976.html\">Hot Water Needs</a>\" Service Magic. n.d. 20 Jan. 2010</cite> Unless your house is unusually big, you can work with this number.\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 2: Buy an insulation kit</h3>\r\nArmed with the knowledge about your heater's size, head to your local hardware store. While shopping for water heater blankets, you'll come across a happy surprise: insulating blankets are down right <i>cheap</i>. Most sell for under $20.
