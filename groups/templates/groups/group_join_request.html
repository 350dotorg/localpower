    Hi all,<br />
    Your team, {{ group }}, is all the rage right now. {{ user.get_full_name }} <br />
    ({{ user.email }}) just requested to join.
</p>
<p>
    Click here to <a href="http://{{ domain }}{% url group_approve group.id user.id %}">accept</a> 
    or <a href="http://{{ domain }}{% url group_deny group.id user.id %}">deny</a> the request
</p>
<p>
    Thanks for steering your team towards a more efficient future!
</p>
<p>
    Remember, {{ group }} is a closed team. Anyone who wants to join the <br />
    team has to get your nod first. To make it open, 
    <a href="http://{{ domain }}{% url group_edit group.slug %}">modify your team setting.</a>
</p>
<p>
    Kudos,<br />
    The Repower at Home team
