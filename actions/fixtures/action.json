Now that we're well into the 21st century, it's time to shake off old fears and embrace the new advances in low-flow shower technology. \r\n\r\nNewer models deliver the water pressure you want, without the waste. Trust us: even if Kramer didn't use a low-flow shower head, the Jetsons definitely have one in their home.  \r\n\r\nStill not ready to make the leap? Consider this: the energy you save by switching one shower head will power your television for over a year.<cite>Installing two low-flow shower heads will save the average household 300 kWh per year: <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/watersense/docs/showerhead_suppstat508.pdf\">WaterSense\u00ae Draft Specification for Showerheads Supporting Statement</a>, p. 5</cite><cite>A 32\" LCD television on for 3 hours, every day uses 139.2 kWh of electricity a year: Bluejay, Michael. \"<a href=\"http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/howmuch.html\">How much electricity does my stuff use?</a>\" n.d. 5 March 2010.</cite> If you have more than one shower in your home, the savings start to really add up.\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 1: Buy a low-flow shower head</h3>\r\n<img align=\"left\" src=\"http://rahstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/actionmedia/watersenselabel.jpg\" width=\"20%\" height=\"20%\">You can find them at any local home improvement store. Starting in 2010, these high efficiency shower heads will carry the EPA WaterSense logo, making them easy to identify. Low-flow shower heads have a flow rate of less than 2.0 gpm, but most homes only need a 1.5 gpm shower head. The flow rate should be listed on the box.  Every shower you take will use 25% less water and energy if you opt for a 1.5gpm shower head over a 2.0 gpm model.\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 2: Install the shower head</h3>\r\nYou can easily do the installation yourself. For step-by-step instructions, refer to <a href='http://www.ehow.com/how_5097759_fit-shower-head.html'>this article</a> or watch the video below.\r\n<center><object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/fGXrlGWJ2XM&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/fGXrlGWJ2XM&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object></center>\r\n\r\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\r\n<strong>How do I know if my current shower head is low-flow?</strong>\r\nThe only way to know for sure is to put a pre-measured bucket under the shower head and turn it on. Measure how much water is left in the bucket after a minute. If you have a low-flow shower head, there should be no more than two gallons of water in the bucket after a minute. \r\nIn reality, most homes do not come with low-flow shower heads installed. Even if your shower head is relatively new, it's flow rate is likely around 2.5gpm. By switching to a 1.5gpm shower head, you would save around $350 over the shower head's lifetime in averted water and energy costs. You'll save nearly twice that if you have an electric-powered water heater!<cite>\"<a href=\"http://www.fypower.org/res/tools/products_results.html?id=100160\">Residential Product Guides: Shower Heads</a>.\" <i>Flex Your Power</i>. n.d. 30 March 2010.</cite> ", "users_completed": 0, "teaser": "The energy you save by switching one shower head will power your television for over a year.

Surely you jest. \r\n\r\nNo, we're as serious as a lower energy bill. Your fan can be a windfall for energy savings all year long. In the summer, your fan cools you down by circulating air and creating a breeze. But in the winter, your fan can keep you warm by pushing the warm air down from your ceiling. \r\n\r\n<h3>Step 1: Reverse the direction of your fan</h3>\r\nPull out the step ladder and get up close and personal with you fan. You'll quickly find the switch that controls the direction of the fan. \r\n\r\nAfter switching, <strong>the blades should rotate in a clockwise direction</strong>. You can check this by watching the blades. The blades should spin with the downward turned side leading.\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 2: Lower your thermostat</h3>\r\nOnce you put the ladder away, scope out how the room feels. Warmer? Pretty cool, right? \r\n\r\nOkay, wipe that smirk off your face. It's not time to rest on your laurels yet. Turning the fan on only saves you money if you also lower your heat. You should be able to lower your thermostat enough to still feel comfortable while saving around 10% on your heating bills.<cite>Underwood, Kristin. \"<a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/10/turn-back-your-clock-and-fan-this-halloween-for-better-energy-savings.php\">Turn Back Your Clock and Fan This Halloween for Better Energy Savings</a>.\" Treehugger.com. 28 Oct 2009. 3 March 2010.</cite>", "users_completed": 0, "teaser": "There's hot air stuck at the top of your ceiling!
