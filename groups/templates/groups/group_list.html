            Are you ready to lead the charge for a cleaner tomorrow? Starting a community is a great way to help
            your neighborhood, church, school, or local group become more energy savvy. As a community leader, you can use your community to
            organize meetings, encourage action, and track progress towards your community's goals.

            <p>
                People across the country are working together to make their homes and their communities better than ever before. As
                part of a community, you can brainstorm ideas for improving your community, share local tips about energy efficiency, and
                meet people who are interested in building a cleaner tomorrow.
