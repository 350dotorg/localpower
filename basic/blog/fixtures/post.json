The secret: you have to use it. Around 70% of American households have thermostats,<cite>ENERGY STAR, <a href=\u201d http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/revisions/downloads/thermostats/Summary.pdf\u201d>Summary of Research Findings From the Programmable Thermostat Market</a></cite> but many of us are missing out on savings by not setting our thermostats correctly.<cite>Ibid.</cite> \r\n\r\nSaving money and energy with your thermostat is easy. Before you go to sleep or leave the house for the day, set back your thermostat. If you turn your thermostat from 72\u00b0 to 62\u00b0 during the winter, you could save <strong>10% on your heating bill</strong>.<cite>U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Savers, <a href=\u201dhttp://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12720\u201d>Thermostats and Control Systems</a></cite> In the summer, raise your thermostat to 82\u00b0. It just takes a few moments every day, and you\u2019ll quickly see real results. \r\n\r\nProgrammable thermostats make saving energy automatic by raising or lowering your thermostat during certain times. There are many different models available, including ones that allow you to program different temperature settings for each day of the week. Your local home improvement store will likely offer a wide range of models. New models are also easier to set than some older versions. You can get started saving energy right away. Once programmed, you\u2019ll never have to remember to set your thermostat again.\r\n\r\nYou have everything to gain by programming your thermostat this month. Try it out, and let us know how it worked for you.",

Environmentally friendly actions like recycling or choosing reusable bags are definitely more visible changes than, say, insulating your attic. But while less obvious, steps that reduce your energy use at home are some of the most important things you can personally do to combat climate change. \n\nDirect energy use by American households accounts for around 38% of U.S. CO2 emissions.<cite>Dietz, Thomas et al., \u201cHousehold actions can provide a behavioral wedge to rapidly reduce U.S. carbon emissions.\u201d PNAS. 106.44 (2009)</cite> That means the emissions from American households are larger than the entire emissions of any other country except China. <cite>Ibid.</cite>\n  \nSave money, Save the world\nThe good news is that our homes represent an enormous opportunity to significantly reduce <strong>global</strong> greenhouse gas emissions. Homeowners across the country have already realized these savings.  The average household that had a retrofit in Maryland, for example, reduced their energy use by more than 20%. <cite>Maryland Energy Administration, <a href=\"http://www.energy.state.md.us/incentives/residential/res_ee.asp\">Maryland Home Performance with ENERGY STARE</a></cite> Even smaller steps, like reducing your hot water use and upgrading your  lighting, start to add up to big rewards. \n\nBest of all, you can personally have an impact on climate change while saving money. Not only is investing in building efficiency the most cost-effective way to combat climate change, it\u2019s actually an overall cost savings.<cite>McKinsey & Company, <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/electricpowernaturalgas/US_energy_efficiency/\">Unlocking Energy Efficiency in the US Economy</a></cite>  Investing in energy efficiency is like paying yourself to do the right thing.\n\nOnline and at our house parties, people across the country are getting geared up to make a big impact on energy waste and greenhouse gases.

It\u2019s responsible for almost half of your energy bill, costing the average home around $1,000 a year to run. Small, inexpensive improvements \u2013 like installing new air sealing \u2013 can add up to huge rewards. \r\n\r\nHot water is another, surprising energy-guzzler. Just heating your hot water uses more energy than running your refrigerator, microwave, and other appliances. By becoming more mindful of your hot water use while showering or washing clothes, you can eliminate waste and higher bills.  \r\n",
