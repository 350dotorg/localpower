At the end of the audit, your auditor will present you with a list of recommendations to solve your home's specific problems.</p>\r\n<h3>Step 4: Complete the retrofit work</h3>\r\n<p>The audit is just the first step! It's good to know where you stand, but you won't start saving energy until you implement the upgrades. With your auditor's recommendations in hand, you can work with a contractor to make the right improvements to your home.

Think about when you typically go to bed, leave in the morning and come home at night. <strong>Set your thermostat to lower your heat or air conditioning while you're asleep or at work, and turn back up by the time you wake up or get home.</strong> During the winter, rolling back your thermostat from 72&deg; to 60&deg; for eight hours a day will save you around 12% on your heating bill.<cite>Department of Energy, Energy Savers, <a href=\"http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12720\">Thermostats and Control Systems</a></cite> You can achieve similar savings in the summer by raising your thermostat.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://rahstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/actionmedia/thermostat activity.pdf\">Download the setback activity sheet</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Common Thermostat Myths</h3>\r\n<h4>\"If I set my thermostat to 80&deg;, my house will get hotter, faster.\"</h4>\r\n<p>Your heating and cooling system only has two modes: on and off. The rate at which it heats or cools your home is unaffected by the temperature setting. By setting your thermostat higher, you&rsquo;re just ensuring that your heater will be on for longer than you need and your house will be hotter or colder than you want. Set your thermostat to the temperature you actually want and let it be.</p>\r\n<h4>\"Turning my thermostat down doesn&rsquo;t really save energy! My HVAC system will just have to work harder when I get back.\"</h4>\r\n<p>This is a common myth, but it's false. Using your thermostat to turn your heat or air conditioner down will save energy. Period.</p>\r\n<p>Consider the following example: Let&rsquo;s say you want your home to be 72&deg; degrees in the winter. You leave your house at 8am and return at 6pm. If you have a programmable thermostat set to turn the heat off, you will use absolutely no energy during that 10-hour period. If you leave your thermostat at 72&deg;, your heat will continually switch on and off, heating an empty house for 10 hours.<br /> When your programmable thermostat switches back on to heat your house, it will stay on for slightly longer than the thermostat that has been left alone. However, the slight increase in energy use during this time period pales in comparison to the energy saved during that 10-hour period.</p>\r\n<h4>\"My pipes will freeze!\"</h4>\r\n<p>If your pipes are not well-insulated inside your home, and the outside air temperature is below 20&deg;, you should consider keeping your thermostat above 55&deg;.<cite><a href=\"http://www.weather.com/activities/homeandgarden/home/hometips/severeweather/pipefreeze_prevent.html\">Severe Weather Readiness</a> Weather.com. n.d. 7 Apr 2010</cite> This setback still allows room for significant savings. However, a much more effective way to prevent your pipes from freezing and bursting is to <a href=\"http://repowerathome.com/actions/insulate-water-pipes/\">insulate exposed pipes</a>.</p>\r\n<p>{% action_form %}</p>",

Americans were still getting used to indoor plumbing, so electric lights were kinda a big deal. Nowadays, many homes are still using lighting technology that's virtually unchanged since Thomas Edison's day. <strong>If you haven't switched out your incandescent light bulbs, you're partying like a Victorian.</strong> Invest in some compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) today and join the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The rewards</h2>\r\n<p>You may have heard it all before, but let's just take a moment to review how awesome CFLs are:</p>\r\n<ul><li>CFLs are <strong>four times more efficient</strong> than outdated incandescent light bulbs.<cite>http://www.greenamerica.org/pubs/realgreen/articles/cfls.cfm</cite></li>\r\n<li>The average home has 45 light bulbs.

July 2008.</cite>.</li>\r\n<li>CFLs <strong>last 10 times longer</strong>, which means fewer trips to the hardware store and fewer arguments over why there's <i>still</i> a blown-out bulb in the kitchen. </li></ul>\r\n{% action_form %}\r\n<h2>Get it done!</h2>\r\n<h3>Buy the bulbs</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Almost every hardware store now carries CFLs</strong>, including big retailers like Target and Home Depot.</p>\r\n<p>The package will tell you what wattage to buy based on the light you're replacing. A 60 Watt incandescent bulb, for example, can be replaced by a 13-15 Watt CFL bulb. <cite>http://energystar.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/energystar.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2563</cite></p>\r\n<h3>Act now</h3>\r\n<p>It's hard to know when it's time to trade in your car for a newer model. Not so with incandescent light bulbs. Every day you wait, you're wasting energy that you could easily be saving. Replace those bulbs today.</p>\r\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\r\n<h3>What's the deal with mercury in CFLs?</h3>\r\n<p>The rumors are true: CFLs contain a small amount of mercury. Really small &mdash; many CFLs now contain less than 1 milligram of mercury.<cite>Ibid.</cite> To put that in perspective, the average aspirin tablet weighs 325 milligrams. Old thermometers, on the other hand, contain around 500 milligrams of mercury<cite>Ibid.</cite> </p>\r\n<p>Because they do contain a small amount of mercury, CFLs should be recycled at the end of their lives. Visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.earth911.org\">Earth911</a> to find a recycling center near you.</p> \r\n<p>No mercury is released when the bulbs are intact. If you do break a bulb, it's okay. Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes. When you come back, use tape to pick up any shards of glass, and vacuum the area thoroughly. For more information about CFL disposal, visit the <a href=\"http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf\">Energy Star information page</a>.</p>\r\n<h4>More CFLs = less mercury</h4>\r\n<p>Say what? It's true. The adoption of CFLs will actually reduce the amount of mercury released into our environment. Since CFLs are so much more efficient, they require much less energy than incandescent bulbs to produce the same amount of light. That means we can significantly reduce our demand for coal, the most common source of electricity in the U.S. Burning coal is a dirty business. It releases all sorts of nasty chemicals, including a lot of mercury. When you compare their life cycle impacts, CFLs leave incadescents behind in a cloud of soot.</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://rahstatic.s3.amazonaws.com/actionmedia/mercury_cfl_coal_graph.png\"><cite>Ibid.</cite>\r\n{% action_form %}",

The only way to reduce this energy use is to turn the computer off or set it to sleep/hibernate.</p>\r\n<h4>\"Screensavers save energy\"</h4>\r\n<p>A computer uses just as much energy when displaying a screen saver as when it's on.</p>\r\n {% action_form %}",
