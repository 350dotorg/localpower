In cold areas, for example, \"low-e\" windows are a good choice. They readily absorb heat and reflect it back into the room. In warm areas, \"spectrally selective\" glass reduces heat gain while allowing light to pass through. \r\n\r\nChoosing the right window will make a big difference in your energy bills. A contractor will be able to tailor recommendations to your home's needs. ",
