Nice! Communities are a great way for  a community  to share ideas, compete with friends and work together to save energy. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs the community administrator, you can invite people to your community, moderate discussions and more by using the tools on your community\u2019s page. <strong>Get started by inviting some friends to join your community</strong>. <a href=\u201dhttp://{{ domain }}{{ content_object.get_absolute_url }}\u201d>Try it out now</a>.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRepower at Home communities often work to organize events in their communities, like <a href=\u201dhttp://{{ domain }}/events/\u201d>energy meetings</a> and challenges to recruit  <a href=\u201dhttp://{{ domain }}/about-pledge/\u201d>Trendsetters</a>.
